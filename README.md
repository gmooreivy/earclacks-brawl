# PROBLEM STATEMENT

    My project aims to solve a problem many people face on a daily basis; boredom. It's a simple game without much substance that won't be published, which is perfect for people with low taste. Nobody is more desperate for entertainment than bored people. This game aims to scratch the ADHD itch many people suffer from

# TARGET USERS

    The game is meant to target people who are extremely bored and desperate. Likely small children on their parents phones. This is not helped by the lack of a mobile port. Another target demographic is Indiana residing computer science qualified teachers who's first name starts with P, as they will be able to judge and grade it.

# PLANNED FEATURES

    The current draft of the game involves 2 physics based bodies with rotating weapons fighting one another through skill (random chance). There are 4 planned weapon types with unique properties, a betting system, and a global leaderboard for who has the highest betting streak. 

# TECHNOLOGY STACK

    I am using Godot 4.0 for development of the game. I plan on making all of the sprites myself as they are very minimalistic. Finally, I plan on using a not-yet-decided public free server host to host the leaderboard server. 

# TIMELINE

    Currently, I have the base physics engine done for the game already, I plan to have all of the weapon types designed, and able to be instantiated by the end of the week. I will need to overhaul most, if not all of my game logic to compensate for this. After that, I will begin work on the UI and scoring. Finally is the creation and integration of the leaderboard, which will take the most time
